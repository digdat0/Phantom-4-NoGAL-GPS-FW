This is for a gent on FB, who ran SuperPatcher on his Phantom 4 standard and it caused problems with GPS using the Galileo GPS mod.

Phantom 4 V02.00.0700
Original FW = V02.00.0700_P4_dji_system.bin

There are two files

1.  Completely Stock parameters, AND revert back to original GPS settings (P4 700 Stock NoGAL)
2. Super patcher parameters, AND revert back to original GPS settings (P4 700 UpdatedParams NoGAL), the paramters came from here: https://github.com/brett8883/Super-Firmware_Cache/tree/master/P4Standard_Super_Patcher_FC

To install, you can use super patcher, and when dumldore prompts for a file, use the one you download here. OR, follow steps from this document: https://wiki.dji-rev.com/howto/manually_installing_custom_fw_from_fc_patcher

This video also provides an overview of using the tool: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFrQ52m8bos
